# Yenting Lin's Homepage

This repository hosts a small personal website served as a single static HTML page. The page is provided in `index.html` and can be deployed using any static file host such as GitHub Pages.

## Files

- `index.html` – the main webpage
- `CNAME` – domain configuration for GitHub Pages
- `LICENSE` – license information
- `README.md` – this file

The previous Jekyll-based setup was removed to keep the project minimal.
